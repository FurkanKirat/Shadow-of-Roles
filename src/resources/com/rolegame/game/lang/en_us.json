Night Phase:\n\nThe game begins at night, and each player, in turn, takes the device to check their role.\nEach player performs their assigned task according to their role and then passes the device to the next player.\nThe night phase ends once all players have completed their tasks.\n\n2. Morning Phase:\n\nIn the morning, each player takes the device in turn to see the results of the task performed by their role during the night.\n\nAfter all players have reviewed their results, the device is returned to the first player, and the voting phase begins.\n\n3. Voting Phase:\n\nBefore voting, players discuss and exchange ideas based on the information they gathered during the night.\nThe voting is open, and each player states their vote in turn, while the first player records the votes.\nThe player who receives more than half of the votes is eliminated.\nAfter voting is complete, the game transitions back to the night phase, and this cycle continues.\nTeams and Objectives\nFolk:\n\nTheir goal is to ensure that, by the end of the game, all surviving players belong only to the Folk team.\nCorrupted:\n\nTheir goal is to ensure that, by the end of the game, all surviving players belong only to the Corrupted team.\nNeutral:\n\nNeutral players have unique win conditions or tasks specific to their roles. Their goal is to achieve their individual objectives.\n\nNote: The game progresses through a day and night cycle, requiring strategy, teamwork, and information sharing to achieve team objectives.",
